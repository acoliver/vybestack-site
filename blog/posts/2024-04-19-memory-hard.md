# Why LLMs Need Memory That Hits Hard
*2024-04-19*

Most LLMs forget. Fast. That’s fine for single-turn queries — but not if you’re building or debugging real codebases.

Vybestack introduces structured memory: deterministic, scannable, and scoped to your workflow. Less guesswork, more impact. This isn’t just a history panel — it’s a memory system built for shipping code, not just chatting about it.

We’re not here for vibes. We’re here for precision, reproducibility, and speed. Memory should be part of your architecture — not a side effect.
