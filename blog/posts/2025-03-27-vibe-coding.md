# Vibe Coding Doesn’t Exist the Way You Think  
*2025-03-27*

People live in different worlds.

In one world, LLMs are so good you can just sit back, vibe, and code magically appears. In another, LLMs are bumbling frauds that trick managers into firing real developers. YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US!!

Reality? It's weirder—and more useful—than both.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet can write solid code and even plan decently—if you load it with *exactly* the right context. GPT-4o can generate killer visuals and even helped me negotiate with Anthropic. When they work together, you can build legit things. As long as you watch them like a hawk.

Case in point: I didn’t code this website. I told GPT what I wanted. Ten corrections later, it got it right. HTML, CSS, GitHub Actions—all done by the model. I *could* have written it myself, but that would’ve meant searching, typing, debugging. GPT was faster. I’m grateful.

A lot of what we build at Vybestack is AI-generated. Not because it’s easy—but because tooling and algorithms are 90% gruntwork. Someone still has to be the brains. Someone still needs to sit in the captain’s chair. But someone else can be the junior dev, following instructions, chasing down APIs.

Claude is my favorite junior dev. GPT? My go-to for “ugh, just reply to this email.”

These tools aren’t competition. No more than a power drill is a threat to a builder. I still code. I still debug—in TypeScript, Python, whatever. I just do more of it in English now. Sometimes Spanish.

Today, LLMs are your junior developers. At Vybestack, we’re building tools to make them your mid-level team. Let the grunts do gruntwork. You? Pick your chair.

Vybe on.
