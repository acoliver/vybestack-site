# Getting Started with Vybestack
*2024-01-12*

Welcome to the Vybestack blog. In this quick intro post, we’re going to outline why this project exists, who it’s for, and where it’s headed.

Vybestack is about enabling AI-first development workflows without sacrificing transparency, control, or developer ergonomics. You write the code. The LLM helps — but it doesn't steer.

Expect future posts to cover CLI interaction patterns, memory strategies, and how to scale code-generation workflows with confidence.
