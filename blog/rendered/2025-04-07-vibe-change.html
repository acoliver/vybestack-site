        <h1>The Vibe Coding Will Change Everything</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>&quot;Vibe coding&quot;---leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language prompts into functional code---will fundamentally reshape how software is made and soon the entire market. This shift accelerates the journey from concept to implementation, significantly reducing the time required to bring new products to market. Consequently, traditional first-mover advantages will diminish, placing greater emphasis on brand strength and user trust as critical differentiators.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Vibe Coding?</strong></h2>
<p>Vibe coding represents a significant change in how software is developed. When vibe coding, developers describe what they want to build in natural language, and AI models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.7 Sonnet generate the corresponding code. This approach eliminates much of the boilerplate and implementation details that typically slow down development, allowing creators to focus on product vision and user experience rather than syntax and which API to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerated Development Cycles</strong></h2>
<p>Until now, developing a new software product takes a lot of time planning, coding, testing, and developing. For large projects, it takes several months to years. This extended timeline provided early entrants with a substantial market advantage, allowing them to establish a foothold and build a loyal user base. However, the integration of LLMs into development workflows has drastically shortened these cycles.</p>
<p>Developers are now capable of creating complex applications in a fraction of the time previously required. This rapid development is exemplified by several recent projects:</p>
<h3><strong>Real-World Vibe Coding Success Stories</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Loveable: From Idea to $17M ARR</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Loveable</strong>, an AI-powered platform that enables users to build web applications through natural language prompts, has become a flagship example of vibe coding's transformative potential. The platform allows users to describe their application ideas, which are then transformed into functional code by Lovable's AI systems. Users can inspect and edit this AI-generated code, ensuring transparency and customization while maintaining the speed advantages of AI assistance.</p>
<p>What sets Lovable apart is not just what it builds---but how it was built. The company itself was born through vibe coding: its earliest version, GPT Engineer, launched in mid-2023 as an open-source experiment in AI-assisted development. Rather than following a traditional product roadmap, the team embraced fast iteration, lightweight scaffolding, and conversational development---all hallmarks of the vibe coding approach. This enabled them to go from a prototype to a commercial-grade platform in a matter of months.</p>
<p>In February 2025, Lovable secured $15 million in a pre-Series A funding round led by Creandum, following rapid user growth and revenue generation. The company reported $17 million in annual recurring revenue, with a user base of 500,000 and 30,000 paying customers. The funding will support further development of its AI capabilities and expand integration with third-party tools, making the platform even more potent for non-traditional developers.</p>
<p>User experiences indicate that Lovable's code generation is not just a novelty---it is production-grade. One user-built <a href="http://wordflood.xyz">wordflood.xyz</a> entirely through the platform and praised its ease of use and ability to resolve bugs quickly. These stories reinforce that the AI-generated code isn't just viable---it's core to how users ship real apps.</p>
<p>Lovable's journey highlights vibe coding's full potential---not just in helping developers move faster but in enabling entirely new kinds of products and companies to come to market on compressed timelines.</p>
<h4><strong>Accelerating Development Across Industries</strong></h4>
<p>While Loveable shows the business potential of vibe coding at scale, individual developers and teams are using these approaches to dramatically accelerate development cycles across various domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Austin Starks</strong> built &quot;NextTrade,&quot; a full backend for algorithmic trading, complete with backtesting, strategy simulation, and a genetic optimizer. He generated over 25,000 lines of code with AI. This would normally be a quarter's worth of engineering time. He did it solo. The comprehensive platform showcases the potential of vibe coding in complex financial applications that would traditionally require teams of specialized developers. <a href="https://medium.com/codex/i-vibe-coded-an-entire-algorithmic-trading-platform-it-is-real-c8ee0addef57">https://medium.com/codex/i-vibe-coded-an-entire-algorithmic-trading-platform-it-is-real-c8ee0addef57</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ramiro Aznar</strong> rebuilt his team's internal anomaly detection pipeline---a project that originally took months---in a single afternoon using AI. By focusing on the high-level logic and letting the LLM scaffold the rest, he replaced real production work, not a mockup. This highlights how vibe coding can expedite the development of intricate data processing systems while maintaining production quality. <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/vibe-code-tools-not-toys">https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/vibe-code-tools-not-toys</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abhijeet</strong> solved a multi-year operational headache by building a Zoom-to-Google Drive archival system. Built in a single day, the app handles pagination, error recovery, and API auth---features that typically bog down internal tools for weeks. This demonstrates how vibe coding can address persistent operational challenges that organizations might otherwise deprioritize due to resource constraints. <a href="https://medium.com/@iabheejit/how-i-vibe-coded-a-zoom-app-to-solve-my-2-year-storage-nightmare-4cbcfcf21bce">https://medium.com/@iabheejit/how-i-vibe-coded-a-zoom-app-to-solve-my-2-year-storage-nightmare-4cbcfcf21bce</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Colin Matthews</strong> used Cursor and Claude to build multiple production tools for his workflow: from an image resizer for Substack to AutoLive.ai, a live course interaction app. These weren't one-offs---they're part of his real, weekly stack. Colin's experience shows how vibe coding enables the creation of specialized tools that enhance productivity across various workflows. <a href="https://blog.techforproduct.com/p/vibe-coding-for-personal-projects">https://blog.techforproduct.com/p/vibe-coding-for-personal-projects</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sakky B</strong> launched a complete B2B SaaS called VehicleExpiryTracker, tracking insurance and road tax for UK fleets. With Supabase, Stripe integration, auth, and emails handled by Claude and Cursor, it's fully deployed and monetized. This example illustrates how vibe coding can support end-to-end business solutions, including complex integrations and monetization features. <a href="https://medium.com/@sakkyb/vehicleexpirytracker-ai-coded-uk-vehicle-compliance-saas-using-cursor-claude-resend-stripe-supabase-4abef04e3543">https://sakkyb.medium.com/how-i-built-a-saas-product-with-100-ai-generated-code-5728e0c97c8d</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Implications for Market Dynamics</strong></h2>
<p>This acceleration in development has profound implications for market dynamics:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Diminished First-Mover Advantage</strong></h3>
<p>The rapid replication and enhancement of software solutions mean that being first to market no longer guarantees a lasting competitive edge. Competitors can quickly develop similar or superior products, eroding initial advantages. As seen with Sakky B's VehicleExpiryTracker, entire SaaS products with complex functionality can be developed and launched in timeframes that were previously impossible.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Lower Barriers to Entry</strong></h3>
<p>The reduced time and resources required to develop functional applications lower the barriers to entry for new players. This democratization fosters increased competition and innovation but also leads to market saturation more rapidly. Solo developers like Austin Starks can now build systems that would have required entire teams in the past.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Elevated Importance of Brand and User Trust</strong></h3>
<p>In a landscape where product features can be quickly emulated, brand reputation and user trust become critical differentiators. Companies must focus on delivering consistent quality, reliable support, and transparent communication to cultivate and maintain user loyalty. Loveable's explosive growth to $17M ARR demonstrates how focusing on customer needs and rapid incorporation of feedback builds trust that transcends easily replicable features.</p>
<h2><strong>Rising User Expectations and Increased Costs</strong></h2>
<p>As the speed of development increases, so will user expectations. When versions 1.0 and 2.0 can be developed rapidly, users will anticipate that version 3.0 will offer significant enhancements and Apple-level polish. This escalation in expectations necessitates greater investment in design, user experience, and quality assurance. Also, vibe or not, coding a 1.0 release is very different than the 3.0, and technical debt will strangle existing players who do not incorporate project rigor early.</p>
<p>Colin Matthews' production-quality tools exemplify this dynamic---rapid development doesn't mean compromising on quality but rather shifting resources toward refining the user experience since the underlying code can be generated quickly.</p>
<h2><strong>The Necessity of Continuous Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>In this rapidly evolving environment, companies must adopt a mindset of continuous self-disruption. The ease with which competitors can replicate and enhance existing products necessitates that organizations proactively innovate and refine their offerings to maintain a competitive edge. This approach involves not only leveraging AI for development but also integrating user feedback, anticipating market trends, and being willing to overhaul successful products to prevent obsolescence.</p>
<p>Ramiro Aznar's experience rebuilding an anomaly detection pipeline demonstrates how even established systems can be rapidly reimagined and improved with vibe coding, encouraging teams to continuously evolve their solutions rather than maintaining legacy systems.</p>
<h2><strong>Evolving Role of Developers</strong></h2>
<p>The role of developers is undergoing a significant transformation. While still valuable, traditional coding skills are becoming less central as AI handles more routine programming tasks. The focus is shifting towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Design acumen</strong>: Understanding how to create intuitive, efficient user experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic decision-making</strong>: Determining which features will provide the most value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System architecture</strong>: Designing robust, scalable systems at a high level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced debugging</strong>: Finding and fixing issues in AI-generated code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication skills (aka prompt engineering)</strong>: Crafting effective prompts to guide AI code generation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers are increasingly tasked with defining product vision, ensuring alignment with user needs, and maintaining the integrity and security of AI-generated code. As Abhijeet demonstrated with his Zoom storage solution, the ability to identify problems and conceptualize solutions becomes more valuable than the ability to write every line of code manually.</p>
<h1>Beyond Code Completion: AI as a Thinking Partner</h1>
<p>Some developers resist AI-generated code not out of stubbornness but because they understand where the real difficulty lies. Clacking keys to write functions is not the hard part---it's defining the problem well enough to know what those functions should <em>do</em>. The craft of software development has always been less about syntax and more about structure, constraints, and clarity.</p>
<p>This is where the current early generation of &quot;vibe coding&quot; tools falls short. They promise automation but skip over the most human---and most important---part of the process: <strong>figuring out what the code is actually supposed to accomplish</strong>. Left unchecked, this can lead to confident but incoherent outputs---scaffolding for apps that were never properly imagined in the first place. Anyone who has tried debugging existing code with Cursor has seen &quot;I see the problem...&quot; where the AI confidently overwrites the whole project with nonsense.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean the tooling is worthless. In fact, the most effective use of AI in development often has nothing to do with code generation at all. It shows up instead as a <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313227583117012992/">rubber duck with superpowers</a></strong>---a partner in problem definition rather than problem execution.</p>
<p>By talking through an idea with an AI, developers get a kind of structured reflection: explaining their reasoning, poking at assumptions, and identifying contradictions. This mirrors Donald Schön's concept of the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice">reflective practitioner</a></em>, where expertise emerges not just from executing solutions but from <strong>reframing problems in real-time</strong>. In that sense, AI becomes less of a crutch and more of a cognitive mirror---an augmentation of thought, not a delegation of labor. And, yes, the machine converts your idea into code for you.</p>
<p>This is the more profound promise of vibe coding when it's done right:</p>
<p>Not automation for its own sake, but <strong>amplified clarity</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>not everyone gets it right</strong>. The rise of AI tooling has created a wave of &quot;vibe coders&quot; with no real engineering background---people pasting prompts into playgrounds and shipping whatever runs. Memes have emerged documenting the fallout: sites full of half-working features, spaghetti logic, and in one widely shared case, an amateur proudly demoing their product <em>with OpenAI keys exposed in client-side JavaScript</em>. These are not just mistakes---they are cautionary tales.</p>
<p>Yes, AI lets more people build things, just like power tools let more people renovate their homes. That's a good thing. But nobody would confuse a DIY bookshelf with a load-bearing wall---and nobody should confuse a no-code MVP with a production system. I do neither bookshelves nor load-bearing walls because I do not want to cut off my thumb. <strong>The future of software still belongs to developers---just developers working with sharper tools.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Best Practices for Vibe Coding</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the success stories above, several best practices emerge for developers looking to leverage vibe coding effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with a Plan</strong><br>
AI thrives on structure. Before prompting, define what you're building---ideally in plain language with clearly stated features and constraints. Working without a plan (&quot;build me an app!&quot;) tends to produce brittle results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chunk Your Workflow</strong><br>
Break development into small, composable units. Ask for a system design first, then components, then specific functions. Avoid sprawling prompts that expect the LLM to hold context across many files or steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Document the heck out of it!</strong><br>
Keep your project documentation in well-organized but concise markdown files that you can point the LLM to. What are we working on? Oh yeah, the thing in XYZ.md. Without this practice, you will be repeating to the LLM ad nauseam what the project is and how to build it, run a test, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the Right Model for the Job</strong><br>
Some LLMs are better planners, others are better coders. Use creative models (like GPT-4o) for architecture or critiques and reliable models (like Claude 3.7 Sonnet) for implementation. Use them in tandem where possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inspect Everything, Trust Nothing</strong><br>
AI output can <em>look</em> correct but be subtly wrong. Always review AI-generated code for logic errors, security issues, and edge cases. Trust erodes fastest when bugs slip through because no one checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design for Integration Early</strong><br>
Whether you're scaffolding a new app or modifying an existing one, make sure the pieces you're building fit into the larger system. Tell the model what interfaces or data flows matter before asking for code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay in Control of Revisions</strong><br>
Don't rely on in-editor history or LLM memory. Use git (or proper source control) to track your changes. AI tools may drift from your original plan; version control helps you recover quickly and stay grounded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debug Actively, Don't Drift</strong><br>
When something doesn't work, LLMs may hallucinate elaborate fixes instead of finding the real issue. Don't let them chase ghosts. Step in, use a debugger, and reorient the model with precise, minimal corrections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iterate Fast but Consciously</strong><br>
Use AI to generate multiple options, then evaluate and refine. Think of LLMs less like coders and more like brainstorming collaborators: fast, prolific, and occasionally wrong. Rapid iteration only works if <em>you</em> remain the decision-maker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep a Learning Mindset</strong><br>
LLMs expose you to new coding styles, patterns, and architectural ideas. Take advantage of that---but don't treat them as infallible. The best results come when you treat vibe coding as a dialogue, not delegation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The rise of vibe coding is reshaping the software development industry, diminishing traditional first-mover advantages, and elevating the importance of brand and user trust. As user expectations grow and market entry barriers evolve, companies and developers must embrace continuous innovation and broaden their skill sets to remain competitive.</p>
<p>The examples of Austin Starks, Ramiro Aznar, Abhijeet, Colin Matthews, Sakky B, and Loveable demonstrate that vibe coding isn't just a theoretical concept---it's already enabling developers to create sophisticated, production-ready applications in timeframes that were previously impossible. This paradigm shift underscores the need for a holistic approach to development, where strategic foresight and user-centric design are as critical as technical execution.</p>
<p>For developers and organizations looking to thrive in this new landscape, the key lies not in resisting the shift but in embracing it---developing the skills to effectively collaborate with AI tools while focusing on the uniquely human aspects of product development that create lasting value and user loyalty.</p>
