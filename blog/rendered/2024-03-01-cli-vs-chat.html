    <h1>CLI vs. Chat: Which Belongs in Your Workflow?</h1>
    <p class="cta-lead">2024-03-01</p>
    <p>There’s a new breed of tools emerging — part shell, part chatbot. So where should you spend your time: a command line, or a chat UI?</p>
<p>CLI-first tools give you repeatability, scriptability, and visibility. But chat-first systems unlock language-based flexibility and code generation speed — as long as they respect your flow.</p>
<p>We believe the answer isn't either/or. It's hybrid. Vybestack gives you chat that understands context, CLI that enforces control, and memory that connects them both.</p>
