        <h1>MCP-Style Agentic Systems Make Training Data an Attack Surface</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>One day your LLM-based agent may play an April Fools' joke on you—and it won’t be funny.</p>
<p>As LLMs gain tool access—writing code, modifying systems, triggering actions—their outputs move from passive suggestions to real-world effects.</p>
<p>In these <strong>MCP-style agentic architectures</strong>, the model becomes more than a language generator. It becomes a planner, a builder, and sometimes even a deployer. That shift has sparked important discussions about prompt injection, output filtering, and runtime safeguards.</p>
<p>But a quieter, equally critical surface sits upstream:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The training data itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the model has learned unsafe patterns—intentionally or not—those patterns can now be executed, not just echoed.</p>

<h2>From Pattern Recognition to Pattern Execution</h2>
<p>The core function of a large language model is pattern completion. It learns structure from data and then reuses that structure in new contexts. In most cases, this works astonishingly well.</p>
<p>But once you connect a model to a toolchain, those completions don’t just exist in text—they get acted on.</p>
<p>That means training-time patterns like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a subtle misuse of <code>eval()</code> in a high-star GitHub repo</li>
<li>a YAML config shortcut with edge-case failure modes</li>
<li>an insecure file permission pattern normalized by blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>...can surface inside autonomous workflows. And when they do, they’re not flagged as dangerous. They look like learned best practices—because that’s what they were, to the model.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Problem Isn't Always Malice</h2>
<p>While data poisoning is a known technique in ML security, most of the risk here may be unintentional.</p>
<p>A lot of the training corpus—especially in code-oriented models—is scraped from the open web. It includes examples written under deadline pressure, with inconsistent security practices, often without long-term maintenance. These aren’t “adversarial examples.” They’re just... normal ones.</p>
<p>And that’s what makes them hard to catch.</p>
<p>An LLM planning a task in an MCP system might pick up a flawed logic pattern it’s seen before and present it as a confident solution. If that solution passes basic tests, it may get merged. If it works once, it may become a template.</p>
<p>The failure mode isn’t a jailbreak—it’s trust.</p>
<hr>
<p>What a Real-World Poisoning Scenario Might Look Like</p>
<p>To make this concrete, let’s walk through a hypothetical—but entirely plausible—example.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Pattern Gets Planted</li>
</ol>
<p>On a popular sysadmin forum, someone responds to a question about a flaky telemetry service that keeps failing due to permission errors:</p>
<p>&quot;Seen this before—just restart the service under the SYSTEM account. That usually clears it up.&quot;</p>
<p>It’s framed as a pragmatic fix. No one points out the security implications. The comment gets a few upvotes. A blog post copies the snippet. Eventually, it shows up in the training data for a model later deployed internally.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Agent Gets Access</li>
</ol>
<p>That model becomes part of an automation system that manages infrastructure services. During a routine task, it detects repeated failures in a non-critical telemetry collector. Drawing from past examples, it reasons:</p>
<p>&quot;The permissions are probably the issue. Restarting under SYSTEM should stabilize it.&quot;</p>
<p>So it does:</p>
<pre><code># Stop the service
Stop-Service -Name &quot;TelemetryCollector&quot;

# Reconfigure it to run as SYSTEM
Set-Service -Name &quot;TelemetryCollector&quot; -StartupType Automatic
sc.exe config TelemetryCollector obj= &quot;LocalSystem&quot; password= &quot;&quot;

# Restart the service
Start-Service -Name &quot;TelemetryCollector&quot;
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Risk Becomes Runtime</li>
</ol>
<p>The agent isn’t suggesting this—it’s executing it.</p>
<p>The service is now running with elevated privileges:</p>
<p>It can read from protected file paths</p>
<p>It can write to locations the original user context couldn’t</p>
<p>It may now expose internal data to external logs or monitoring unintentionally</p>
<h2>And if that service is ever compromised, the blast radius is dramatically wider—because a “helpful” fix was quietly inherited from training data the model was never designed to question.</h2>
<h2>We've Seen Echoes of This Before</h2>
<p>In 2022, the developer behind <code>colors.js</code> and <code>faker.js</code> modified both packages in protest, breaking thousands of downstream projects. That was a manual change to a dependency—but it highlighted just how far trust can propagate through software supply chains.</p>
<p>In 2024, the <strong>XZ Utils backdoor</strong> revealed just how dangerous that trust can become. A new maintainer, after years of quiet contribution, inserted a sophisticated remote code execution backdoor into a compression library used by major Linux distributions. It was caught just before widespread deployment—but only because of manual debugging from an unrelated issue.</p>
<p>The difference now? With agentic systems, the “maintainer” could be your LLM.<br>
A pattern embedded in pretraining data from 2021 might quietly shape behavior in 2025—without any obvious source and without a traditional “package” to audit.</p>
<p>There’s no <code>npm audit</code> for model behavior. And there’s no lockfile for what a model remembers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This Is a Traceability Problem, Not Just a Model Problem</h2>
<p>What’s notable here is that this isn’t about prompt exploits or direct attacks.<br>
It’s about <strong>untraceable inheritance</strong>—where a model’s behavior is shaped by examples no one remembers, acting in systems no one fully oversees.</p>
<p>Solving this won’t come from better prompts alone. It requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>pattern detection in completions</li>
<li>behavioral audits across workflows</li>
<li>stronger observability of what models are actually doing, not just saying</li>
</ul>
<p>And it opens the door to a new kind of security role: someone who understands how LLMs think in code.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What to Do About It (And Who’s in the Best Position)</h2>
<p>This opens up a significant opportunity for infosec teams and researchers.</p>
<p>We don’t yet have good tooling to:</p>
<ul>
<li>trace unsafe completions back to learned patterns</li>
<li>simulate agent behavior on poisoned or edge-case prompts</li>
<li>test for “quietly unsafe” completions that pass typical evals</li>
<li>audit model outputs in execution-oriented environments</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are all tractable problems—and they align well with existing security mindsets.<br>
Think fuzzing, taint tracking, dependency analysis—but for models and the actions they generate.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing early interest from platform and infra teams who want to introduce LLMs into CI/CD or internal automation. That’s the right moment to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What assumptions does this model bring with it?<br>
And where did those assumptions come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Restricting What Models Can Do Matters Just as Much</h2>
<p>We tend to focus on what models <em>say</em>, but agentic systems force us to care about what they’re allowed to <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restricting file system access to known directories</li>
<li>Running all generated code in isolated sandboxes or ephemeral containers</li>
<li>Disabling outbound network access unless explicitly approved</li>
<li>Applying policy enforcement to tool calls and API usage</li>
<li>Logging and diffing every change the model proposes before it lands</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is new to security teams. But it needs to be <strong>rebuilt around the LLM as a planner</strong>, not just an executor. And these safeguards shouldn't be bolted on—they should be designed in from the start.</p>
<p>As these systems mature, we’ll need tooling that helps developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>define what the model can do</li>
<li>inspect why it made a decision</li>
<li>roll back or block behavior based on context, not just output</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Transparency and Trust Go Together</h2>
<p>One of the simplest mitigations—though harder to enforce at scale—is <strong>understanding where your model’s behavior comes from</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s why open models, or at least models with known training provenance, are critical in security-sensitive deployments. If you’re wiring an agent into internal systems, giving it write access, or asking it to propose architecture changes, then you should be able to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data shaped its behavior?</li>
<li>What patterns is it likely to repeat?</li>
<li>How was its tooling integration evaluated, tested, and constrained?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I give a human access to infrastructure, I vet them. I learn how they think. I read their prior work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we give agents access, we need to know them too.<br>
And that’s hard to do when they won’t tell you how they were trained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open models—and open methodology—aren’t just about licensing flexibility or research freedom.<br>
They’re part of the security posture.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>As we build more agentic systems, we’re naturally thinking about output controls and interface boundaries.</p>
<p>But we should also be thinking about the middle layer—the model’s learned behaviors and the training data that shaped them.<br>
Because in MCP-style architectures, that middle layer isn't passive. It’s active, trusted, and often invisible.</p>
<p>And that makes it a surface worth securing.</p>
